# Solar-System
This code creates a basic simulation of a solar system using HTML, CSS, and a placeholder for JavaScript. The HTML file sets up the structure of the solar system by defining elements for the sun and planets. CSS is used to style these elements, setting their sizes, colors, positions, and defining basic animations for the planets' orbits.
