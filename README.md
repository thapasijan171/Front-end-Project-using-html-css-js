# Frontend-Project
I developed a frontend project as part of my learning journey in web development. Through this project, I applied various front-end technologies and techniques such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface. This hands-on experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of web development concepts, improve my coding skills, and gain practical experience in building responsive and visually appealing web applications. Overall, the project served as a valuable learning tool to enhance my proficiency in frontend development.
